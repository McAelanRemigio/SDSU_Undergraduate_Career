## CS 210 – Data Structures and Algorithms

### Core Concepts Learned
- Object-oriented design principles, including interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Fundamental data structures:
  - Lists, stacks, queues
  - Hash tables and map/dictionary abstractions
  - Trees and graphs
- Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and their implementations
- Algorithmic problem-solving strategies
- Sorting algorithms (comparison-based slow and fast methods)
- Tree and graph traversal techniques:
  - Binary search trees
  - Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS)

### Algorithmic & Computational Skills
- Analyzing algorithmic complexity and efficiency
- Evaluating tradeoffs between different data structures and designs
- Applying algorithmic thinking to model and solve computational problems
- Designing and implementing moderately complex software systems
- Using modern programming tools and workflows, including the C++ build and packaging process
- Writing code with attention to scalability, performance, and maintainability
