## Case Study Context

This case study was completed **independently and outside the scope of formal coursework** for CS 514.

While CS 514 covered foundational topics in database theory and implementation, this specific design problem was **not assigned or completed as part of the class**. Instead, it was created as a **self-initiated exercise** to synthesize course concepts into a realistic, end-to-end database design scenario.

The case study is **entirely original** and was developed to:
- Reinforce conceptual understanding beyond class requirements  
- Practice translating real-world requirements into relational schemas  
- Demonstrate applied database design thinking for portfolio and professional use  

The design and documentation continue to be refined iteratively as part of an ongoing personal knowledge base.

## Case Study Summary

The project explores the design of a relational database to support the operational and analytical needs of student organizations, including membership tracking, event attendance, and leadership roles over time. The focus is not on implementation details, but on **thoughtful schema design**, **data integrity**, and **long-term analytical usability**.

Core database concepts applied in this case study include:
- Translating real-world organizational requirements into a relational model  
- Designing normalized schemas that minimize redundancy and anomalies  
- Modeling many-to-many and time-bound relationships explicitly  
- Preserving historical records without overwriting data  
- Supporting analytical queries through intentional schema structure  

The resulting schema emphasizes:
- Clear entity relationships  
- Referential integrity via primary and foreign keys  
- Third Normal Form (3NF) normalization  
- Scalability for longitudinal analysis  

This case study was created as a **portfolio artifact and personal learning exercise** to demonstrate applied database design thinking beyond classroom assignments. It reflects an emphasis on clarity, maintainability, and analytical reliability rather than course-specific deliverables.

The design continues to be refined as part of an ongoing personal knowledge base.
