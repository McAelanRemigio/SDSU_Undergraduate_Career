# Remote Work and Leisure Time: A Differences-in-Differences Analysis

## Overview

This project investigates whether remote work during and after the COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in leisure time for workers. Using **American Time Use Survey (ATUS)** data and a **Differences-in-Differences (DiD)** approach, we compare time-use trends for workers in remote-eligible jobs versus those in non-remote jobs before and after the pandemic.

## Research Question

> **Did remote work lead to an increase in leisure time for remote-eligible workers post-COVID?**  
We seek to understand if flexibility from remote work translated into more leisure or simply blurred the lines between work and personal life.

---

## Motivation

COVID-19 changed how we work. Remote work offered flexibility and eliminated commutes, but it's unclear whether that actually gave people more *leisure time*. This analysis helps answer that question using causal inference methods and real-world data.

## Methodology: Differences-in-Differences (DiD)

### Formula (Algebraic Intuition)

(Treatment_post - Treatment_pre) - (Control_post - Control_pre) = DiD Estimate

### Model-Based Formula

```math
Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Post}_t + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Treatment}_i + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{Post}_t \times \text{Treatment}_i) + \varepsilon_{it}
```

This allows us to control for confounders, get p-values, and interpret coefficients.

### Assumption: Parallel Trends
We assume that in the absence of the pandemic, both remote-eligible and non-remote workers would have followed similar time-use trends. Historical data from 2015–2019 is used to support this.

### Hypotheses
Null Hypothesis (H₀): No differential change in work time between remote-eligible and non-remote workers post-pandemic (DiD = 0).

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Remote-eligible workers experienced a greater decrease in work time post-pandemic (DiD < 0), implying more leisure time.
