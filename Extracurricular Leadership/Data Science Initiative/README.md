# Data Science Initiative (DSI) — San Diego State University

**Role:** Founding President & Director of Student Consulting  
**Timeframe:** January 2024 – January 2026  
**Location:** San Diego, CA

## Why I Started DSI

I founded the Data Science Initiative during my freshman year because SDSU didn’t have a dedicated home for data science students. At the time, I was one of the few students formally studying Data Science, and I kept running into the same gap: people interested in the field had no consistent way to connect, collaborate, or build practical experience together.

DSI started as a simple idea: create a real community around data science at SDSU. The key difference that separates it from other student organizations? It was the one that was opportunity-driven, skill-building, and rooted in applied work.

## What I Built

### 1) A student community with real structure
- Founded and scaled SDSU’s first data science organization to **160+ members**
- Built the early structure of the organization and recruited a founding team to sustain growth
- Prioritized **depth and impact over breadth:** the goal was not to “collect members,” but to build a strong first wave of true data science culture at SDSU

### 2) A year-long skill-building curriculum (early DSI)
- Designed an academic year-style learning plan intended to teach the fundamentals of data science (from foundations → applied skills)
- Created a consistent cadence to push members toward actual competence rather than passive participation

### 3) A student consulting arm (DSI Consulting)
- Built and led a student consulting arm delivering projects for **university units and startups**
- Created project-team structures (project leads + deliverables) to simulate real-world experience
- Helped students translate classroom skills into portfolio-ready work

## Outcomes I’m Proud Of

- **160+ members** joined DSI as a sustained campus community
- DSI Consulting contributed to internship outcomes, including **15–20+ students** landing their first data internships (undergrad + grad)
- Secured partnerships with startup leaders and campus units to create clearer pipelines from student learning → applied experience
- Advocated persistently for a peer until they successfully secured a paid summer role and full stipend (their first internship)

## Leadership Decisions and Tradeoffs

DSI wasn’t built by waiting for permission. I chose to make it visible and high-commitment early because I wanted it to become a real movement at SDSU, even if that meant taking on risk early as a freshman.

Some tradeoffs I made intentionally:
- **Depth over breadth:** I focused on building a high-signal environment rather than trying to appeal to everyone
- **Structure over vibes:** I built curriculum and projects because “community” without skill-building doesn’t move people forward
- **Opportunity-first:** I prioritized creating pipelines, projects, and mentorship because access matters more than slogans

## What I Learned (the honest part)

Building DSI taught me leadership isn’t just vision. Its operations, people, and emotional control. Most importantly, it taught me that impact and sustainability are not the same thing.

Early on, I leaned heavily on my board for community-building, which pushed me to develop delegation and trust sooner than expected. I also learned that intensity can drive momentum in the short term, but without careful scoping, it increases burnout risk.

Building the student consulting arm reinforced the importance of tracking progress, accountability, and sustainable scope when running applied programs at scale.

Leadership classes felt “theoretical” until I lived them. Transformational leadership, in particular, ended up being real: the founding group didn’t just gain skills. In every case, we became better teammates, professionals, and people.

## How DSI Connects to My Work Now

DSI shaped how I approach data science: I care as much about building *people* as building models. I’m drawn to work that is applied, ethical, and grounded in real outcomes. I take sustainability seriously now (not just intensity).
