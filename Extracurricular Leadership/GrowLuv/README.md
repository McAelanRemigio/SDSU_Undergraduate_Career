# GrowLuv SDSU Chapter — San Diego State University

**Role:** Co-Founder  
**Timeframe:** January 2025 – December 2025  
**Location:** San Diego, CA

## Why I Got Involved

I helped establish the GrowLuv SDSU Chapter to create a space centered on **mental wellness, care, and genuine student connection**. At the time, I was deeply involved in technical and professional leadership roles, and I saw a need for a community that prioritized vulnerability, reflection, and support alongside ambition.

GrowLuv was intentionally designed to be people-first rather than performance-driven.

## What I Did

- Co-founded the SDSU chapter of GrowLuv as part of a national mental wellness nonprofit
- Helped shape the early structure and values of the chapter, emphasizing openness, care, and student-led engagement
- Supported community-led activities focused on connection rather than metrics or outcomes
- Contributed light organizational tracking (e.g., participation trends) without over-formalizing a space meant to prioritize trust and psychological safety

## Impact and Scope

- Engaged **70+ students** through community-based activities and conversations
- Created a low-pressure environment for students to connect outside academic or professional expectations
- Offered an alternative leadership and community model centered on well-being rather than productivity

---

## What I Learned

GrowLuv reinforced that not every meaningful space benefits from optimization or heavy analytics.

I learned that leadership sometimes means:
- Knowing when **not** to measure
- Allowing community norms to develop organically
- Stepping back once a space is established and supported

This experience shaped how I think about sustainability, boundaries, and people-centered leadership.

## How GrowLuv Fits Into My Broader Work

GrowLuv complements my more technical and professional leadership experiences by grounding them in empathy and care. It reminds me that effective leadership is not only about building systems, but also about creating environments where people feel supported enough to grow.
