## Why I Joined SSA

The Society of Statisticians & Actuaries (SSA) is a long-standing student organization within SDSU’s statistics department, historically serving students in applied statistics and actuarial science. I joined SSA immediately upon arriving on campus and held multiple leadership roles as the organization moved through periods of stability, rebuilding, and eventual decline tied to cohort changes within the department.

This experience gave me early exposure to leadership inside an existing institutional structure rather than building something from scratch.

## What I Accomplished 

### Programming and Academic Support
- Recruited guest speakers from **Google**, **UCLA**, **Brown University**, and **SDSU alumni**, representing both industry and academic perspectives
- Coordinated and supported academic programming, including exam review sessions, project help, and study groups
- Led **STAT 350A** study sessions during Fall 2023, facilitating review for upper-division students despite being a first-year student at the time

### Operations and Outreach
- Assisted with event logistics, setup, and coordination
- Promoted SSA through campus partnerships, word-of-mouth outreach, and cross-organization collaboration
- Conducted light tracking of attendance and engagement using sign-in data to understand participation trends

## Scale and Impact

- SSA maintained a historical membership base of **180+ students**
- Typical meeting attendance ranged from:
  - ~25 students during periods of stability
  - ~15 students during rebuilding efforts
  - Fewer than 10 students during later semesters as departmental cohorts shifted

Despite declining attendance, SSA programming continued to provide:
- Direct exposure to industry and academic career paths
- Niche insight into actuarial science and applied statistics
- A professional bridge between coursework and real-world expectations

## Leadership Experience and Growth

Leading SSA differed significantly from founding DSI. Rather than creating new systems, I worked within an existing organization, learning how leadership functions under constraint.

Key differences included:
- Shadowing experienced officers before stepping into executive responsibility
- Experimenting with leadership styles in a lower-risk environment
- Navigating institutional inertia and limited recruitment pipelines

This experience helped clarify what kind of leader I wanted to be and highlighted the importance of structure, clarity, and adaptability.

## How SSA Influenced What Came Next

My time in SSA directly informed the creation of the **Data Science Initiative (DSI)**. While SSA served students in applied statistics and actuarial science, I saw a growing population of data science students without a comparable home.

DSI emerged as a complementary successor focused on data science identity, applied learning, and opportunity-building, and was shaped by lessons I had learned while leading SSA.
