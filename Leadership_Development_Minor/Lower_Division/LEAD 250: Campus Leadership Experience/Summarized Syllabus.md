COURSE OVERVIEW:
The field lab in leadership is an opportunity for you to apply leadership theory and readings to
practice through integrating the knowledge you gained in LEAD 205 to your experience in a
specific leadership position on campus where you are able to lead others. In this course, you will
identify a particular leadership role that you will hold during this semester. We will meet
throughout the semester to discuss your experiences, explore emergent leadership, and work to
develop your leadership abilities and identify ways in which you can continue your leadership
journey. While the focus of this course is to provide you with support as you apply learning to
practice and gain valuable leadership experience, you will complete required assignments
designed to facilitate reflection and provide you with constructive feedback during your
leadership journey.
