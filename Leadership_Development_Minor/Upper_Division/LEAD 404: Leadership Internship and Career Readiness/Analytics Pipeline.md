## Attendance & Sentiment Analytics Pipeline (Conceptual)

### Overview
During my internship, I developed a repeatable process for collecting, cleaning, and analyzing attendance and post-event survey data to support program evaluation and resource allocation.

### Data Sources
- Event attendance records
- Post-event survey responses

### Processing Workflow
1. Data ingestion from attendance logs and survey exports
2. Cleaning and standardization of responses
3. Aggregation of attendance and sentiment metrics
4. Summary reporting for stakeholders

### Metrics Tracked
- Attendance volume and trends
- Sentiment indicators from survey responses
- Program-level engagement patterns

### Output
- Summary tables and reports used in decision-making discussions
