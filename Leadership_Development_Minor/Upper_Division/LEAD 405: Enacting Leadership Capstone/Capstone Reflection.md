## Capstone Artifact

As part of this capstone, I authored a reflective essay examining my leadership
development and the shift from performative leadership toward authenticity
and growth.

The piece synthesizes leadership theory, lived experience, and personal
reflection developed across the Leadership Minor. It received faculty
feedback and was shared within professional networks, informing continued
mentorship and refinement of my leadership approach.

## Capstone Synthesis

LEAD 405 required integrating leadership theory, field experiences, and
personal reflection into a coherent leadership framework. Rather than
introducing new concepts, the course emphasized intentional leadership,
self-efficacy, and the transition from student leadership to post-graduation
contexts.

## Leadership Philosophy

I view leadership as creating impact through depth rather than breadth.
Meaningful leadership prioritizes sustained influence, thoughtful engagement,
and developing people over maximizing visibility or scale.

At its core, my leadership approach centers on bringing out the best in others
by creating environments where individuals can grow, contribute fully, and
reach their potential. Leadership, to me, is measured by the growth and success
of the people it supports.
