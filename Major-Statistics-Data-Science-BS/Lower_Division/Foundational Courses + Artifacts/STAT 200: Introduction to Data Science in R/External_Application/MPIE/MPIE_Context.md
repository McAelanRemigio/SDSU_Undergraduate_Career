## External Application Context

While enrolled in **STAT 200**, I began contributing to the **Mathematics Persistence Through Inquiry and Equity (MPIE)** research project.

The Mathematics Persistence Through Inquiry and Equity Project is a project I joined to analyze course pass rates in HSI as a Track 1 project, use data science, R programming, data analysis techniques.

The work performed for MPIE was **not part of STAT 200 coursework** and was obtained independently of the class. However, the timing of these experiences overlapped: I was formally learning R in an academic setting while simultaneously applying R-based data analysis skills in a real research environment.

This parallel learning experience accelerated my understanding of R by exposing me to:
- Real-world data cleaning challenges
- Applied statistical analysis in a research context
- Iterative problem-solving beyond structured coursework

MPIE artifacts are documented separately to maintain academic and research boundaries. This note is included here solely to provide context on how classroom learning intersected with applied experience during this period.

## **About Me**  
I am **McAelan Remigio**, an undergraduate data scientist contributing to this project.  
- I joined the team in **2024** as a **first-year student**, working on **databases in Excel/Google Suite**, then expanded my work to **R programming** for data science and data analysis.  
- This repository showcases my **applications of R** in real-world research settings.
