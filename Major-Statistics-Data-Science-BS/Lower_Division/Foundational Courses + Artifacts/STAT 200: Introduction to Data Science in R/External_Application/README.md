### **Mathematics Persistence Through Inquiry and Equity Project**  

This repository contains R scripts used to analyze course pass rates based on various factors as part of the **Mathematics Persistence Through Inquiry and Equity (MPIE) Project**.  

## **Project Overview**  
With support from the **National Science Foundation's Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program**, this Track 1 project studies major reform efforts designed to improve student success in gateway mathematics at a two-year HSI. It aims to develop **inquiry-based and equity-driven interventions** to support STEM achievement.  

### **Why This Matters**  
Gateway mathematics courses—the first transfer-level mathematics courses for most STEM-intending students—traditionally have **high failure rates** and can act as a barrier for students from historically underserved communities. In addition, state laws affecting student placement are reshaping these courses.  

With this project, a collaborative team from a **two-year institution and a four-year institution** is:  
- Analyzing trends in **student success**  
- Developing **classroom-based interventions** and **professional development** for instructors  
- Studying the impacts of these interventions  
- Examining the **sustainability of institutional change efforts**  

This work is expected to impact up to **10,000 students** across the project's lifespan. By improving these courses, we aim to **broaden participation in STEM fields** and contribute valuable research to institutional change efforts at two-year HSIs. Findings will be shared through **research publications, workshops, professional development conferences, and network improvement communities**.

## **Repository Purpose**  
This repository contains R scripts for **data analysis and visualization** of course pass rates in gateway mathematics courses. The scripts focus on:  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Statistical analysis of pass rates across different student groups  
- Visualizations and insights to inform policy changes  

## **Data Privacy Notice**  
- This repository does **not** contain any actual student data.  
- All datasets used are kept private and are **not included in this repository**.  
- Example or synthetic datasets may be used for demonstration purposes.
