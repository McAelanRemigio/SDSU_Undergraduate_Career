## STAT 350A – Statistical Methods

### Course Focus
- Introduction to core methods of statistical inference
- Emphasis on hypothesis testing, estimation, and interpretation
- Development of statistical reasoning for drawing conclusions from sample data
- Focus on theoretical understanding supported by textbook-based examples

### Core Skills & Concepts Learned
- Hypothesis testing:
  - One-sample and two-sample hypothesis tests
  - Paired difference tests
  - Interpretation of p-values and significance levels
  - Understanding the power of hypothesis tests
- Estimation and confidence intervals:
  - Confidence intervals for means, proportions, and differences
  - Margin of error and sample size determination
  - Assumptions underlying interval estimation
- Variance and distribution-based methods:
  - Tests for population variances
  - Chi-square tests:
    - Goodness-of-fit tests
    - Tests of independence
- Linear models:
  - Simple linear regression
  - Correlation analysis
  - Interpretation of regression coefficients
  - Model assumptions and limitations
- Additional inferential methods:
  - Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
  - Introduction to simple nonparametric tests

### Course Context
This course serves as a foundational upper-division statistics requirement, supporting later coursework in statistical inference, regression analysis, and applied data science. The emphasis is on **conceptual understanding and statistical judgment**, providing the theoretical groundwork for interpreting and applying statistical methods in more applied settings.
