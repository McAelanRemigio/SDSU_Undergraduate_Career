## STAT 350B – Statistical Methods II

### Course Focus
- Extension of statistical inference methods introduced in STAT 350A
- Emphasis on applied statistical modeling and interpretation
- Focus on understanding relationships between multiple variables
- Application-oriented treatment of regression and experimental-style models

### Core Skills & Concepts Learned
- Multiple linear regression:
  - Modeling relationships between a response variable and multiple predictors
  - Interpretation of regression coefficients and interaction terms
  - Model assumptions, diagnostics, and limitations
- Factorial models:
  - Analysis of experiments with multiple factors
  - Main effects and interaction effects
  - Interpretation of factorial model output
- Nonparametric methods:
  - Situations where parametric assumptions are violated
  - Rank-based and distribution-free inference techniques
- Applied statistical reasoning:
  - Selecting appropriate models for applied problems
  - Interpreting statistical output in context
  - Communicating results and limitations clearly

### Course Context
This course builds on the inferential foundation established in STAT 350A and shifts emphasis toward **applied modeling and interpretation**. The material supports more advanced coursework in regression analysis, experimental design, and applied data science by strengthening students’ ability to model, evaluate, and explain complex relationships in data.
