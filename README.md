# 📘 Undergraduate Coursework Repository  
**Data Science & Leadership | San Diego State University**

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of my undergraduate coursework in **Data Science** and **Leadership** at **San Diego State University (SDSU)**. It serves as both:

- A **personal knowledge base** for long-term reference and reflection  
- A **professional portfolio** demonstrating the concepts, tools, and skills I developed throughout my undergraduate experience

Rather than uploading graded homework or exams, this repository emphasizes **original, self-authored content** that reflects genuine learning, application, and growth.
