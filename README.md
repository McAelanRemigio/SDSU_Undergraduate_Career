# 📘 Undergraduate Coursework Repository  
**Data Science & Leadership | San Diego State University**

---

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of my undergraduate coursework and applied academic work in **Data Science** and **Leadership** at **San Diego State University (SDSU)**.

It serves two main purposes:

- As a **long-term reference** for concepts and skills I learned throughout undergrad (because it’s surprisingly easy to forget things after four years)
- As an **academic and professional portfolio** demonstrating that I can meaningfully explain, apply, and reflect on the tools and ideas I studied

This repository intentionally does **not** function as a homework archive. I do not upload graded exams or assignments. Instead, it focuses on work that reflects **genuine learning, application, or synthesis**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Content is organized primarily by **major, division level, and course**.

### Data Science Major

- **Lower Division**
  - **Foundational Courses**  
    These folders typically contain a single summarized syllabus. For completeness and consistency, I used AI-assisted summarization for these syllabi, as the goal was documentation rather than reinterpretation.
  - **Foundational Courses with Artifacts**  
    Select lower-division courses where I found meaningful ways to apply the material beyond the classroom.

- **Upper Division**
  - Organized using the same structure, with greater emphasis on applied work, notes, and reflection where appropriate.

### Leadership Minor

- **Lower Division**
  - Foundational coursework with brief documentation
- **Upper Division**
  - A small number of courses, most of which include artifacts and reflections due to their strong personal and developmental impact

### Extracurricular Leadership

This section documents meaningful leadership experiences outside the classroom, including organizations I founded or served in leadership roles for. Artifacts here focus on applied leadership work, decision-making, and impact rather than participation alone.

### Additional Files

- **README.md** — the document you’re currently reading  
- **Undergrad Class Progression.md** — a reflection on how I chose my coursework over time, including tradeoffs between experience and internships

## 📁 What You’ll Find in Course Folders

Depending on the course, folders may include:

- 📒 **Original notes and conceptual summaries**
- 📊 **Applied projects or example analyses**
- 💻 **Programming work and real-world use cases**
- 🧠 **Reflections, leadership artifacts, and personal takeaways**

Some courses contain **limited or no artifacts** due to:

- Transfer credit  
- AP credit  
- Placement exams  

These courses are still listed for **curricular completeness** and may be marked as *credit-only* or *anticipated*.

## 📜 Content & Academic Integrity

- ✅ All substantive content and artifacts reflect **my own academic work and understanding**
- ❌ No exams, graded homework submissions, or copyrighted instructional materials are included
- 🧾 This repository is intended for **learning documentation and professional context**, not course replacement or redistribution

AI tools were used sparingly and transparently (e.g., for syllabus summarization), never as a substitute for academic work or original reasoning.
